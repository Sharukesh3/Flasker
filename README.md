Welcome to My Flask Learning Journey!
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Git repository showcasing the files I've created while learning Flask. This repository serves as a compilation of my progress and experimentation with Flask, a fantastic web framework in Python.

What's Inside?
[Templates]
These are the templates used in the render template in the code.
Some of these contain code from Bootstrap.

[gitignore]:
Has the ignored files while pushing to git.

[Requirements]
Contains the libraries which have been pip-installed in the virtual environment

# Getting Started
If you want to explore these files or Flask itself, feel free to clone or fork this repository. To set up and run any Flask applications, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository: Use git clone https://github.com/sharukesh3/flask.git in your terminal.
Install Dependencies: run `pip install -r requirements.txt`(Installing in a virtual environment like virtualenv is highly recommended)

Run the Application: Navigate to the project folder and run python app.py (or the main Python file) to start the Flask application.
